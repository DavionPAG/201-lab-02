    <h1>A bit about me.</h1>
  </header>
  <Main>
    <p>My name is Davion Garcia. I was born in Jamaica and moved to Florida when I was 14. I joined the Air Force after
      graduating high school and served 7 years. After separting in 2019, I started an AA Carpentry program at Seattle
      Central College which I completed in August of this year. I am currently working as Carpenter for a small home
      remodeling company.
    </p>
    <p>My aim as of now is to spend as much time as possible learning to code. I enjoy working as a Carpenter, but I know that my time in this field is limited.
