    <h2>A bit about me.</h2>
    <p>My name is Davion Garcia. I was born in Jamaica and moved to Florida when I was 14. I joined the Air Force after graduating high school and served 7 years. After separting in 2019, I started an AA Carpentry program at Seattle Central College which I completed in August of this year. I am currently working as Carpenter for a small home remodeling company. 
      <br>My aim as of now is to spend as much time as possible learning to code. I enjoy working as a Carpenter, but I do know that my time in that field is limited.
